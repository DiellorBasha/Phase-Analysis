# Phase-Analysis

Phase-Analysis is a collection of MATLAB routines to help you analyze the phase relationship of various discrete and continous events in electrophysiological recordings. It relies largely on the [Circular Statistics toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10676-circular-statistics-toolbox-directional-statistics) developed by Philip Berens.

### Dependencies

- [Circular Statistics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10676-circular-statistics-toolbox-directional-statistics)

## How to use

- Prepare your local field potential data by bandpassing it in your frequency of interest
- Spike data should consist of two vectors: one containing spike times and the other spike codes (cell 1, cell 2 etc.)
